Fill in your answers here

a = 08
b = 12
(a+b) mod 5 = 0

# Part B

Erase the text about the illusions that you are not working on.  Only one left should be the one that matches your part A answer


## Illusion 0

## Marked up Image

Shape types (number each of these):
* Diamonds
	- width = 60
	- height = 60(3^(1/2))
	- arguments required:
		* x,y coordinate of centre of diamond
		* colour of diamond
* Lines
	- no default length
	- 4 units thick
	- arguments required:
		* x,y coordinate of left end of line
		* length of line
		* colour of line


Equations for illusion size.  Show how you arrived at this number (what did you have to add up).

Width = 630
Height = 412.8

Remember to mark up your image with this information

## Finding patterns

Fill in the location of the first 3 instances of each shape.  If you counted different colours separately  in your markup, you will need to do this for each colour

* Diamonds
	* shape 1:
		-id = 0
		- x = 60
		- y = 30(3^(1/2))
		- colour = 0 (black)
	* shape 2:
		-id = 1
		- x = 120
		- y = 30(3^(1/2))
		- colour = 255 (white)
	* shape 3:
		-id = 2
		- x = 180
		- y = 30(3^(1/2))
		- colour = 0 (black)

* Lines
	* shape 1:
		-id = 0
		- x = 30
		- y = 30(3^(1/2)) 
		- length = 30
		- colour = 255 (white)
	* shape 2:
		-id = 1
		- x = 60
		- y = 30(3^(1/2)) + 3
		- length = 30
		- colour = 255 (white)
	* shape 3:
		-id = 2
		- x = 90
		- y = 30(3^(1/2)) 
		- length = 30
		- colour = 0 (black)


* let X(id) represent function for X-coordinate given id for shapes on the top row
* let Y(id) represent function for Y-coordinate given id for shapes on the top row
* let C(id) represent function for colour given id for shapes on the top row
* let L(id) represent the length for the colour of given shapes in the top row.

Fill in the equations:

* Diamond
	X(id) = 60+60*(id%8)
	Y(id) = 30*1.72 + (((id-(id%8))/8)*60*1.72)
	C(id) = (((id%2) + ((id-(id%8))/8))%2)*255
* Lines
	X(id) = 30+((id%16)*30)
	Y(id) = 30*1.72 + ((((id%2) +((id-(id%16))/16) )%2)*3)+  (((id-(id%16))/16)*60*1.72)
	L(id) = 30
	C(id) = ((((id+1)%2) + (((((id-(id%16))/16)*60*1.72)%2)-(((((id-(id%16))/16)*60*1.72)%2)%1)) +((((id+1)-((id+1)%2))/2)))%2)*255



### Generalized function:

* let X(id) represent function for X-coordinate given id for shapes
* let Y(id) represent function for Y-coordinate given id for shapes
* let C(id) represent function for colour given id for shapes
* let L(id) represent the length for the colour of given shapes

Fill in the equations

* Diamond
	X(id) = 60+60*(id%8)
	Y(id) = 30*1.72 + (((id-(id%8))/8)*60*1.72)
	C(id) = (((id%2) + ((id-(id%8))/8))%2)*255
* Lines
	X(id) = 30+((id%16)*30)
	Y(id) = 30*1.72 + ((((id%2) +((id-(id%16))/16) )%2)*3)+  (((id-(id%16))/16)*60*1.72)
	L(id) = 30
	C(id) = ((((id+1)%2) + (((((id-(id%16))/16)*60*1.72)%2)-(((((id-(id%16))/16)*60*1.72)%2)%1)) +((((id+1)-((id+1)%2))/2)))%2)*255





# Part D: Reflection

**Briefly explain how you worked out your equation for the general equation for part B.**


**What information was useful for doing this? The marked up image?  The samples values? What helped you get to the result?**


**How difficult was it to translate your mathematical expressions into code?**



**What was the most interesting thing you learned in doing the assignment?**
